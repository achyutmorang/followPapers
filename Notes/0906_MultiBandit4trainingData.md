* Multivariate regression models for age estimation are a powerful tool for assessing abnormal brain morphology associated to neuropathology. Age prediction models are built on cohorts of healthy subjects and are built to reflect normal aging patterns. The application of these multivariate models to diseased subjects usually results in high prediction errors, under the hypothesis that neuropathology presents a similar degenerative pattern as that of accelerated aging.

* In this work, we propose an alternative to the idea that pathology follows a similar trajectory than normal aging. Instead, we propose the use of metrics which measure deviations from the mean aging trajectory.

* Our approach assumes that pathologic brain patterns are different to those of normal aging. We present results for subjects with autism, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimerâ€™s disease to highlight the versatility of the approach to different diseases and age ranges. We evaluate volume, thickness, and VBM features for quantifying brain morphology.

### ML language

**Training data**

select a subset of the data fro training that is most relevant for a specific task.
>an adequte training set is becoming more important to address the heterogeneity of datesets. Simply including all the data does not only *incur* high processing costs but can even harm the prediction.

We formulate the smart and efficient selection of a training dataset from a big medical image data as a multi-armed bandit problem.
>related to **Active learning** which aims to select samples to be labled out of a pool of unlabeled data.

We hypothesize that given this partitioning, where exist clusters that contain more relevant samples than others for a specific task. Intuitively, we would like to draw samples h from clusters with a higher probability of returning a relevant sample.


**Reinforcement learning**
We formulate the selection of the samples to be included in a training set as reinformcement learning, *where a trade-off must be reached between the **exploration** of new sources of data and the **exploitation** of sources that have been shown to lead to informative data points in the past*.

We model this as a multi-armed bandit problem solved with Thompson sampling, where each arm of the bandit corresponds to a cluster of samples generated using meta information.
