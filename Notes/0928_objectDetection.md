### Context Reasoning 
> How to efficiently and effectively **incorporate contextual information** remains to be explored, ideally guided by how humans are quickly able to guide their attention to objects of interest in natural scenes.

* very limited progress in exploiting contextual information

### Weakly Superised or Unsupervised learning
Fully supervised learning has serious limitations: **not scalable in the absence of fully labelled training data**, therefore it is valuable to study how the power of CNNs can be leveraged in weakly supervised or unsupervised detection
