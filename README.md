## How to read a paper, Anki!

[Anki](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html)


### Ankifying a paper - through read

AlphaGo - learn the matieral from scratch ...
* read quickly, almost skimming
	> simply identify the most important ideas in the paper

* hoovering process, looking for basic facts that I could understand easily
	> easily picked up during an initial pass over the paper, with occasional digressions to search Google and Wikipedia. while these facts were easy to pick up in isolation, they also seemed likely to be *useful in building a deeper understanding* of other material in the paper.

* made *several rapid passes over the paper* in this way, each time getting deeper and deeper.
	> At this stage I was trying to build up my background understanding, instead of a complete understanding of AlphaGo. At all times, if something wasn't easy to understand, I didn't worry about it, I *just keep going*. But as I made repeat passes, *the range of things that were easy to understand grew and grew*. 

* after *five or six such passes over the paper*, I went back and attempted a thorough read. 
	> This time the purpose was to understand AlphaGo in detail.

* after doing one thorough pass over the AlphaGo paper, I made a second thorough pass, in a similar vein.
	> Yet more fell into place. By this time, I understood the AlphaGo system reasonably well. Many of the questions I was putting into Anki were high level, sometimes *on the verge of original research directions*. 

* continued to add questions, ending up adding several hundred questions. by this point the hardest work had been done.
	> Had I used conventional note-taking in my original reading of the AlphaGo paper, my understanding would have more rapidly evaporated, and it would have taken longer to read the later papers. Anki gave me confidence I would *retain much of the understanding over the long term*. This confidence, in turn, makes the initial act of understanding more pleasurable, since you believe you're **learning something for the long haul**, not something you'll forget in a day or a week

* this entire process took a few days of my time, spread over a few weeks. That's a lot of work
	> However, the payoff was that I got a pretty good basic grounding in modern deep reinforcement learning. With a few days work I'd gone from knowing nothing about deep reinforcement learning to a durable understanding of a key paper in the field, a paper that made use of many techniques that were used across the entire field. This foundational kind of understanding is a good basis on which to build deeper expertise.


**intellectually appealing & emotional commitment**
* These are goals are intellectually appealing, but which I'm not *emotionally invested in*. I've tried this a bunch of times. It **tends to generate cold and lifeless Anki questions**, questions which I find hard to connect to upon later review, and where it's difficult to really, deeply internalize the answers. The problem is somehow in that initial idea I “should” learn about these things: intellectually, it seems like a good idea, but **I've little emotional commitment**.

By contrast, when I'm reading in support of some creative project, I ask much better Anki questions. I find it easier to connect to the questions and answers emotionally. 



### Ankifying a paper - shallow read

* Most of my Anki-based reading is much shallower than my read of the AlphaGo paper. Rather than spending days on a paper, I'll typically spend **10 to 60 minutes**, sometimes longer for very good papers.

* typically spend **a few minutes assessing** a new article. Does the article seem likely to ...
	* contain **substantial insight** 
	* **provocation relevant** to my project – new *questions*,*ideas*,*methods*,*results*? 
	* If so, I'll have a read.

* Anki questions, doesn't mean reading every word in the paper
	* particularly helpful to extract Anki questions from the abstract, introduction, conclusion, figures, and figure captions. I'll add to Anki questions about the core claims, core questions, and core ideas of the paper. 

	* typically extract **5 to 20 Anki questions** from the paper. usually a bad idea to extract fewer than 5 questions – doing so tends to leave the paper as a kind of isolated orphan in my memory. 
		> Later I find it difficult to feel much connection to those questions. Put another way: if a paper is so uninteresting that it's not possible to add 5 good questions about it, it's usually better to add no questions at all.

	* typically spend **10 ~ 60 minutes Ankifying a paper**, with the duration depending on my judgment of the value I'm getting from the paper. However, if I'm learning a great deal, and finding it interesting, I keep reading and Ankifying. Really good resources are worth investing time in. 

* It's a failure mode to spend too long reading unimportant papers. It's nearly always possible to read deeper into a paper, but that doesn't mean you can't easily be getting more value elsewhere. 



### Syntopic reading using Anki

You might suppose the foundation would be a shallow read of a large number of papers. In fact, to **really grok an unfamiliar field, you need to engage deeply with key papers** – papers like the AlphaGo paper.

What you get from deep engagement with important papers is more significant than any single fact or technique: 

* It helps you get a sense for what a powerful result in the field looks like. It helps you **imbibe the healthiest norms and standards** of the field.

* It helps you **internalize how to ask good questions** in the field, and how to put techniques together.
	> Such things aren't captured individually by any single Anki question. But they begin to be captured collectively by the questions one asks when engaged deeply enough with key papers.

* to get a picture of an entire field, I usually begin with a truly important paper, ideally a paper establishing a result that got me interested in the field in the first place.
	+ I do a thorough read of that paper, along the lines of what I described for AlphaGo. 
	+ Later, I do thorough reads of other key papers in the field – ideally, the best 5-10 papers 
	+ Interspersed, I also do shallower reads of a much larger number of less important (though still good) papers, In my experimentation so far that means tens of papers...


One surprising consequence of reading in this way is how much more enjoyable it becomes. I've always enjoyed reading, but starting out in a challenging new field was sometimes *a real slog*, and I was often *bedeviled by doubts that* I would ever really get into the field.

Now I have confidence that I can go into a new field and quickly attain a good, relatively deep understanding, an understanding that will be durable. That confidence makes reading even more pleasurable*

### More patterns of Anki use

* Make most Anki questions and answers as atomic as possible

* Anki use is best thought of as a virtuoso skill, to be developed
	> Anki is an extremely simple program: it lets you enter text or other media, and then shows you that media on a schedule determined by your responses.

* Anki isn't just a tool for memorizing simple facts. It's a tool for understanding almost anything
	+ Break things up into atomic facts. Build rich hierarchies of interconnections and integrative questions. Don't put in orphan questions.

	+ Patterns for how to engage with reading material. Patterns (and anti-patterns) for question types. Patterns for the kinds of things you'd like to memorize.

	+ Anki skills concretely instantiate your theory of how you understand; developing those skills will help you understand better. It's too strong to say that to be a virtuoso Anki user is to be a virtuoso in understanding. But there's some truth to it.

* Use one big deck

* Avoid orphan questions
	>  But if a substantial minority of your questions are orphans, that's a sign you should concentrate more on Ankifying questions related to your main creative projects

* Construct your own decks
	> The most important reason is that making Anki cards is an act of understanding in itself. That is, figuring out good questions to ask, and good answers, is part of what it means to understand a new subject well. To use someone else's cards is to forgo much of that understanding.

	+ it's possible to try to remember as an isolated fact that 1962 was the year the first telecommunications satellite, Telstar, was put into orbit. 

	+ But a better way of remembering it is to **relate that fact to others**. Relatively prosaically, you might observe that Telstar was launched just 5 years after the first Soviet satellite, Sputnik. It didn't take long to put space to use for telecommunications. 

	+ Less prosaically – a richer elaboration – I personally find it fascinating that Telstar was put into orbit the year before the introduction of ASCII, arguably the first modern digital standard for communicating text. Humanity had a telecommunications satellite before we had a digital standard for communicating text!  **Finding that kind of connection** is an example of an elaborative encoding.

	+ The act of constructing an Anki card is nearly always a form of **elaborative encoding**. It forces you to think through alternate forms of the question, to consider the best possible answers, and so on. 

* What about memory palaces and similar techniques? There is a well-known set of memory techniques based around ideas such as memory palaces, the method of loci, and others.

* What you Ankify is not a trivial choice: Ankify things that serve your long-term goals.
